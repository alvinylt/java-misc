## ShiftCipher

`ShiftCipher` is an implementation of Caesar cipher encryption.

By inputting a shift factor within the range from -26 to 25,
a string can be encrypted. The code also demonstrates to use of ASCII character
codes.

The characters are case-sensitive and are always retained. Numbers and
special characters are not shifted. 

### Example

With the inputs `Hello` and `3`, the output `Khoor` is expected.
